**Ofelia** is a modern and low footprint job scheduler for __docker__ environments, built on Go. Ofelia aims to be a replacement for the old fashioned [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

### Why?

It has been a long time since [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) was released, actually more than 28 years. The world has changed a lot and especially since the `Docker` revolution. **Vixie's cron** works great but it's not extensible and it's hard to debug when something goes wrong.

Many solutions are available: ready to go containerized `crons`, wrappers for your commands, etc. but in the end simple tasks become complex.

### How?

The main feature of **Ofelia** is the ability to execute commands directly on Docker containers. Using Docker's API Ofelia emulates the behavior of [`exec`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/exec/), being able to run a command inside of a running container. Also you can run the command in a new container destroying it at the end of the execution.

## Configuration

### Jobs

[Scheduling format](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) is the same as the Go implementation of `cron`. E.g. `@every 10s` or `0 0 1 * * *` (every night at 1 AM).

**Note**: the format starts with seconds, instead of minutes.

you can configure four different kind of jobs:

- `job-exec`: this job is executed inside of a running container.
- `job-run`: runs a command inside of a new container, using a specific image.
- `job-local`: runs the command inside of the host running ofelia.
- `job-service-run`: runs the command inside a new "run-once" service, for running inside a swarm

See [Jobs reference documentation](docs/jobs.md) for all available parameters.

#### INI-style config

Run with `ofelia daemon --config=/path/to/config.ini`

```ini
[job-exec "job-executed-on-running-container"]
schedule = @hourly
container = my-container
command = touch /tmp/example

[job-run "job-executed-on-new-container"]
schedule = @hourly
image = ubuntu:latest
command = touch /tmp/example

[job-local "job-executed-on-current-host"]
schedule = @hourly
command = touch /tmp/example


[job-service-run "service-executed-on-new-container"]
schedule = 0,20,40 * * * *
image = ubuntu
network = swarm_network
command =  touch /tmp/example
```

#### Docker labels configurations

In order to use this type of configurations, ofelia need access to docker socket.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --label ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.schedule="@every 5s" \
    --label ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.command="date" \
        mcuadros/ofelia:latest daemon --docker
```

Labels format: `ofelia.<JOB_TYPE>.<JOB_NAME>.<JOB_PARAMETER>=<PARAMETER_VALUE>`.
This type of configuration supports all the capabilities provided by INI files.

Also, it is possible to configure `job-exec` by setting labels configurations on the target container. To do that, additional label `ofelia.enabled=true` need to be present on the target container.

For example, we want `ofelia` to execute `uname -a` command in the existing container called `my_nginx`.
To do that, we need to we need to start `my_nginx` container with next configurations:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --label ofelia.enabled=true \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.schedule="@every 5s" \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.command="uname -a" \
        nginx
```

Now if we start `ofelia` container with the command provided above, it will pickup 2 jobs:

- Local - `date`
- Exec  - `uname -a`

Or with docker-compose:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  ofelia:
    image: mcuadros/ofelia:latest
    depends_on:
      - nginx
    command: daemon --docker
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    labels:
      ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.schedule: "@every 5s"
      ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.command: "date"

  nginx:
    image: nginx
    labels:
      ofelia.enabled: "true"
      ofelia.job-exec.datecron.schedule: "@every 5s"
      ofelia.job-exec.datecron.command: "uname -a"
```

**Ofelia** reads labels of all Docker containers for configuration by default. To apply on a subset of containers only, use the flag `--docker-filter` (or `-f`) similar to the [filtering for `docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/#filter). E.g. to apply to current docker compose project only using `label` filter:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  ofelia:
    image: mcuadros/ofelia:latest
    depends_on:
      - nginx
    command: daemon --docker -f label=com.docker.compose.project=${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    labels:
      ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.schedule: "@every 5s"
      ofelia.job-local.my-test-job.command: "date"

  nginx:
    image: nginx
    labels:
      ofelia.enabled: "true"
      ofelia.job-exec.datecron.schedule: "@every 5s"
      ofelia.job-exec.datecron.command: "uname -a"
```


### Logging
**Ofelia** comes with three different logging drivers:
- `mail` to send mails
- `save` to save structured execution reports to a directory
- `slack` to send messages via a slack webhook
- `signal` to send messages via signal

These can be configured by setting the options listed below in the `[global]` section of your config.ini, or via docker labels on the `ofelia` container (regardless of where your job will actually be running).

#### Options
- `smtp-host` - address of the SMTP server.
- `smtp-port` - port number of the SMTP server.
- `smtp-user` - user name used to connect to the SMTP server.
- `smtp-password` - password used to connect to the SMTP server.
- `smtp-tls-skip-verify` - when `true` ignores certificate signed by unknown authority error.
- `email-to` - mail address of the receiver of the mail.
- `email-from` - mail address of the sender of the mail.
- `mail-only-on-error` - only send a mail if the execution was not successful.

- `save-folder` - directory in which the reports shall be written (must already exist).
- `save-only-on-error` - only save a report if the execution was not successful.

- `slack-webhook` - URL of the slack webhook.
- `slack-only-on-error` - only send a slack message if the execution was not successful.

- `signal-` - URL of the slack webhook.
- `slack-only-on-error` - only send a slack message if the execution was not successful.

**Signal** - to send messages to Signal need to start and configure signal-cli-rest-api from here: https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api
- `signal-url` - URL of the signal-sli-rest-api server like 'http:localhost:6001'
- `signal-number` - number FROM message will be sent (Must be already registered) like: '+48123456789'
- `signal-recipients` - list of recipients (could be a number or group Id like: 'group.TkpRc6pmK2ZwdVN2SCtSClFhMExwMWVMYkQ5RDNnSkl2UC9PMXVhV1FyUT0='
- `signal-only-on-error` - only send a signal message if the execution was not successful.

### Overlap
**Ofelia** can prevent that a job is run twice in parallel (e.g. if the first execution didn't complete before a second execution was scheduled. If a job has the option `no-overlap` set, it will not be run concurrently. 

## Installation

The easiest way to deploy **ofelia** is using *Docker*. See examples above.

If don't want to run **ofelia** using our *Docker* image you can download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia/releases) page.

> Why the project is named Ofelia? Ofelia is the name of the office assistant from the Spanish comic [Mortadelo y Filem√≥n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mort_%26_Phil)
